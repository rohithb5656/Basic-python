The key is like an identifier or label, and the value is the associated data.\n","\n","Example: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}. Here, 'name' and 'age' are keys, and 'Alice' and 30 are the corresponding values.\n","\n","2.Hashing: Python dictionaries use a technique called hashing to store keys efficiently.
